# About me


My name is Jayashree Nagarajan and I live and work in San Francisco Bay Area, CA.

I have spent the last five years working on game development projects and related areas. My passion for technology goes beyond building games. I am intrigued by and love the new face of technology today and the Internet of Things.

After pursuing my masters degree in Computer Science at UCLA, I made a strong footing in my career at TicTocGames as a lead Unity game developer. I had my first mobile iOS game published to AppStore, something I am still proud of. I moved to Qualcomm Inc. to work on emerging augmented reality technologies. As a Unity3D and mobile application developer I have enjoyed the many perks of experimenting and prototyping rich AR experiences on the newest mobile and wearable devices. The work that I enjoyed the most here are with building mobile apps powered by Vuforia and Unity, many of which have been showcased in developer conferences and tech shows. I am currently a Senior mobile developer at DAQRI, a Technology Start-up that has lately redefined its presence in Augmented Reality and Internet of Things, as a sole maker of wearable Smart Helmets, specifically designed for industrial use cases.

My passion for technology hasn't limited my capabilities to express just a work. I have always loved and taken advantage of the new-age social mobile space to express myself and grow my curiosity to explore. I've been lately teaching myself the nuts and bolts of Android framework and end-to-end application engineering. There's no match to the power of actually building an app to express your ideas to the world! You can check some of my recent android projects on GitHub. Look out for first android app on Google PlayStore that I'd be able to publish pretty soon :)

I am a big time foodie. I love to cook and a huge advocate of healthy mind and body. Outside of work, my daily yoga practices take the highest priority. I love working out, traveling to unknown destinations and meeting new people.
